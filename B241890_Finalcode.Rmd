## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Outcomes: During this period of time, male MPs have always held significant influence, especially between 2001 and 2015, when the number of speeches by male MPs exceeded those by female MPs. However, the number of speeches by female MPs has gradually increased, indicating a growing presence of women’s voices in the political arena. The sharp decline in speeches by both male and female MPs between 2015 and 2017 can be attributed to a narrower time frame.The dominance of men in text output indicates that men have a greater voice in the relevant field or are more involved in the context of text generation. For women, this may imply gender inequality in representation and fewer voices in public forums and politics.

#Outcome: The graph shows how male and female MPs use specific terms differently. The diagonal line represents terms used equally by both genders, while deviations from this line show words used more by one gender than the other. Male and female MPs frequently use words like “government”, “bill”, “committee”, and “hope”, which are distributed similarly between the genders as shown by their placement on the diagonal. However, there are slight differences in the distribution of certain words. For instance, words like “women” and “carers” are positioned to the left of the diagonal, indicating a higher prevalence among female MPs. Additionally, female MPs often discuss topics such as “divorce” and “abortion”, whereas male MPs show a preference for words like “armed” and “military”. These differences reflect potential gender stereotypes and suggest that MPs speak on issues aligned with their gender identity. Female MPs prioritize women’s issues and focus on social topics.

```
#Outcome: Male MPs used words related to "leadership" such as "authority" and "rule" more frequently compared to female MPs, with usage rates approximately 0.013% and 0.017% higher, respectively. However, both male and female legislators used the word “decisive” less frequently. These results suggest that male MPs are more inclined to use language reflecting authority and regulation in their speeches.

       title = "Proportional Use of Caring Words") +
  theme_minimal()
```
#Outcome: In the set of words associated with caring, female MPs had a higher proportion of usage for all three words compared to male legislators. The word “care” showed the largest difference in usage proportion, with female MPs using it about 0.14% more than male MPs. Additionally, for the words like “aid” and “concern,” female MPs had approximately 0.1% and 0.025% higher usage proportions, respectively. This pattern could be interpreted as female legislators being more inclined to use language that expresses care and empathy. This tendency may be related to gender roles or linguistic habits traditionally associated with women.

#Outcome: Show ten high frequency words under ten themes for male MPs, and have a general view of their debate topics. Male MPs predominantly focus on government-related topics, reflecting societal expectations of male leadership in politics. They also address social issues, but these discussions often take a back seat to governmental matters. Female MPs prioritize discussions on social welfare, rights, and equality more than male MPs. This emphasis reflects societal expectations for women to focus on community and welfare issues in politics. The use of terms like “women” and “rights” by female MPs indicates a growing recognition of gender equality and civil rights in political discourse. This underscores the evolving role of women in addressing social challenges and advocating for inclusive policies within political contexts.

#outcome: This graph shows the emotional scores of female MPs of male MPs under different themes. For male MPs, there is not a significant difference between positive sentiment and negative sentiment across these 10 topics. This suggests that the language used by male MPs in their speeches may be more balanced, with no clear bias towards extremely positive or extremely negative expressions of emotion. In contrast, significant differences can be observed in the sentiments expressed by female MPs. The emotional score range of female parliamentarians is larger than that of male MPs, indicating that female MPs tend to express a broader range of positive and negative emotions than men.

#Outcome: The higher sentiment score among male MPs is attributed to difference between their positive sentiment score (13.5) and negative sentiment score (-11). In contrast, female MPs have higher scores in both positive (14.5) and negative (-12.7) emotions, but the difference in emotion scores is narrower compared to male MPs. This phenomenon is likely linked to gender stereotypes and societal expectations placed on female MPs. Women are often perceived to be more empathetic and emotionally expressive, leading female MPs to prioritize discussions on social issues over their male counterparts. Addressing these issues helps female MPs connect with the public, requiring strategic emotional expression to resonate effectively with their audience.
